Let's take a systematic approach, and start by focusing on the only
really important version --- wfg2.

For ease of comprehension, can we make the preprocessor go through a
file and process just the #if statements?  Not as far as I can tell :)
I'm not going to spend all morning trying to make cpp do something it
was definitely not intended for.

All right, so let's look at every alloc and every free.  I've pasted
them below, but the first point I want to make is, wow, that's a lot
of allocs.  However, as you look at them, the actual allocs are fewer.

Now, let's focus on wfg.c in particular.

Line 121:
What      : Points
How many  : maxm, the size of the biggest front we're going to have to
            deal with
Opt level : 0 only
Notes     : This is where, as we get deeper in recursion, we allocate
            a new front if we need it.  That's the opt=0 strategy,
            which is obviously silly.  I don't know if it's
            mathematically impossible not to recurse all the way down,
            but it certainly seems unlikely and it adds significant
            additional complication.

Line 124:
What      : objectives
How many  : nobj --- the number of objectives for the biggest front in
            the input file
Opt level : 0 only
Notes     : For each point in the front, allocate the objectives.
            This goes right along with 121 which allocates the points
            themselves.

Line 365:
What      : Frontstack, i.e. space to hold all of the front structures
How many  : One, enough to hold maxm (i.e. max number of points in any
            front in the file.)
Opt level : 0 only
Notes     : The number of fronts to be allocated for other opt levels
            is similar, but there are some (questionable?) space
            optimizations.

Line 371:
What      : Frontstack again.
How many  : One, but now just enough to hold nobj - (opt / 2 + 1)
            fronts.
Opt level : 1, 2 and 3
Notes     : Let's unpack that.  Now, instead of recursing as many
            times as you have points, you recurse as many times as you
            have *objectives*, minus one.  At least for opt=1 or 2.  For
            opt=3, you recurse as many times as you have objectives,
            minus *two*.  One versus two must have something to do
            with the number of objectives handled by the special case
            algorithms, like the AVL-tree one that handles 3D.
Lifetime  : Allocated when we call allocate_fronts in
            compute_hypervolume.  Freed at the end of
            compute_hypervolume.

Line 377:
What      : Allocate points for each front
How many  : maxm + 2*(opt/3)
Opt level : 1,2,3
Notes     : How many is that really?  As many as there are points in
            the biggest set, plus 2 if opt=3.  This whole integer
            division business is far too cute for its own good.  Is
            that really saving us a significant amount of time
            compared to a conditional?  In fact, I can answer that
            definitively, no, because opt is being used in #if
            statements all over the place, so it's actually more
            expensive than abusing the preprocessor like the source
            does everywhere else.

Line 380:
What      : Allocate an avl node
How many  : One for every point in every front
Opt level : 1,2,3
Notes     : AVL is clearly only being used if opt=3.  Why are we
            allocating space for AVL nodes that's not getting used on
            levels 1 and 2?  Just because it's easier and presumably
            doesn't carry much overhead?  If we're doing that though,
            surely we could spare the extra cycles for a conditional
            instead of doing cute integer division tricks.  Even if
            the conditional were, gasp, actually compiled.

Line 382:
What      : The objective values for a point
How many  : For every point in every front, allocate a decreasing
            number of objectives.  What?  I think I may have missed a
            crucial point here.  nobj - (i+1)*opt/2
Opt level : 1, 2, or 3
Notes     : So opt=2 or 3 saves you i+1 points because of slicing.
            But what is this thing that's happening, where we not only
            need only as much depth as objectives, but we drop an
            objective every time we recurse?  
            Also, this is what valgrind flags as *definitely lost*.
            So, this is, at least for opt=2, the one and only
            remaining leak.
            So what's going on?  We never as far as I can tell
            overwrite objectives, other than individually overwriting
            the values.  Nor are we losing points, because Valgrind
            says we don't leak them.  I'd 

Line 405:
What      : AVL tree structure
How many  : One
Opt level : 1, 2, or 3
Notes     : Should be 3 only.  We don't use AVL at all otherwise.

Line 410:
What      : Call to alloc_fronts
How many  : One
Opt level : All
Notes     : See 365-382
